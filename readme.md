# MadLads
**MadLads** is a mobile web app reinvention of the famous phrasal template word game called Mad Libs, in which a player is prompted to fill in blanks to create a custom story. We took the same concept and incorporated machine learning and image recognition into the process of choosing words. In order to pick a word for the fill-in-the-blank, the user takes a photo of an object, which is then recognized and inputted into a list. After choosing up to five words, the user is presented with the crafted story, often humorous. The user then has a choice to try again for a different story with different words.

Created at the **Bitcamp 2019** hackathon, winning the **Best First Time Hack** prize!
